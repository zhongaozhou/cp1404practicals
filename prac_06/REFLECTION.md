# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

Now I am using more appropriate Git processes like regular branching (master - feedback branches). 
I am also gradually engaging more time into reading questions properly then coding them and 
do paper planning on complicated issues. This time estimation practice has assisted me to be 
more realistic in estimating the time of activities.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I should also learn to start the practice earlier in the week rather than making it the last minute. 
I need to also allocate more time to go through lecture content before I can practice the practical and 
learn more methods of debugging. 
In my learning process, I would also become more active in seeking assistance when I am in a jam.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I am always finishing all of the practical work and keeping up with the best practice of 
writing good Git commit messages. The culture of ensuring that the code is tested in and out has been useful. 
To enhance my planning skills, I will keep on recording my time estimates and actuals.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I should stop hurrying through the preliminary understanding phase and take more time in designing before execution. 
I ought to stop developing the habit of thinking that I have the requirements without checking. 
In addition, I should minimize distractions when studying in order to increase focus and efficiency.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

The examples of common debugging situations and solutions would be useful to have more. 
In the general degree, increased exposure to collaborative coding projects would be more representative of 
the actual conditions of collaborative coding development in the real world and 
would not eliminate the essential individual foundation of the work we complete in courses such as the one.
