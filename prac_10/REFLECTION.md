# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

I was fairly accurate in my estimate, which were usually only 10-15% of the amount of time that I needed. 
I have discovered that my estimates were quite precise when dealing with smaller and more definite tasks such as 
implementing individual classes or simple functions. But when more extensive, complicated tasks were involved with 
a number of elements or new terms I was more likely to underestimate the time required.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

During the subject, my level of accuracy in estimation improved considerably. I frequently underestimated things 
by 30-50% at the beginning since I did not consider debugging, testing and unforeseen obstacles. 
Towards the conclusion of the subject, I had learned to factor these considerations in a more effective way 
and my estimates became far more realistic. I also began to subdivide big tasks into smaller parts and 
estimate them on an individual basis and this made it much more accurate.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that estimation is a competence which needs to be practiced and thought about. The lesson that I found 
the most useful was the knowledge about my own work patterns - now I am aware that I should spend more time on 
testing and debugging. I also learnt to make more identification of the work that is more uncertain and develop 
buffers. The habit taught me to be more truthful with myself about the duration that things actually take to 
complete rather than how I would like them to take.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Having a review helped me understand the need to write readable code that can be maintained by other parties 
and should be understood. I was informed that every detail such as name consistency, positive commenting and 
correct formatting count a lot in the readability of code. The edge cases that reviewers frequently uncovered 
were ones that I did not think about and proposed more efficient methods. This has helped me realize more the 
need to write code in a way that the reader can understand rather than the way it works.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

The reviews of other code made me aware of the general patterns and anti-patterns in code. 
I found out to seek chances and propose improvements to code organization, effectiveness, and readability. 
It also helped me become more understanding - now I can recognize that there are usually many right methods 
to getting out of a problem. The review helped me to encounter other types of codes and methods of coding 
that could be used in my personal practice.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[1](https://github.com/elijahangJCU/cp1404practicals/pull/5)

### Explanation

This review proves extensive feedback on various files. The gap that I detected in both SilverServiceTaxi and 
UnreliableCar types of objects was missing str methods that are needed to represent the object properly and debug it. 
I also made constructive recommendations towards better coverage of test by suggesting more test scenarios of 
various situations. The comments about breaking the taxi simulator into smaller functions, such as choose_taxi(),
drive_taxi(), and display_taxis() indicate that one understands the principles of good software design and 
maintenance of code structure.

### Good Code Review 2

[2](https://github.com/AshleyTXH10/cp1404praticals/pull/3)

### Explanation

In my review, I have given concrete and practical feedback that dwelled upon the quality of code and best practices. 
I found the missing section of the README of the form About me and drew attention to the absence of a form to 
add new guitars, which was one of the central requirements. My other indication of knowledge of maintainable 
code practices was the proposal to define VINTAGE_REQUIREMENT as a constant rather than magic numbers. 
The idea to have a special printing operation was a concern about the organizing of codes and the 
Single Responsibility Principle.


## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

In my case, I would add more incremental building exercises, in which we would begin with a simple implementation 
and gradually add features during various practicals. This would be more realistic to software development 
in the real world. I would also add to the activities more pair programs and code reviewing in groups to 
focus on collaborating skills. More examples of typical debugging situations and solutions are also I would give, 
as debugging is a very essential skill and in many cases, it is very time-consuming to establish.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I was good in the consistency of application of object-oriented principles in various practicals. My code 
exhibited sufficient knowledge on encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. I ensured the best of practices 
with Git, including clear commit messages and branching patterns. I also performed excellently in the area of 
ensuring that my code is fully tested prior to submission and in the area of documenting my thinking by comments 
and docstrings. The practice of time estimation which I practice on a regular basis allowed me to acquire 
the best project management skills which I used in all my activity.
