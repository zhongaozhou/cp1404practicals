# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

85%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I usually watch them at home, around 7â€“9pm, for about one hour at a time.  

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I learnt all the basic things and rules for Python and keep on doing the practical homeworks.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to take more time for the lectures and focus on the details.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I am not quite familiar with the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP, functions should do one thing).
So, I should do more practice to understand SRP.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I can use the git properly, and I think it is really helpful.
