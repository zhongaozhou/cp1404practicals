# CP1404 Practicals

Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

## About Me

I am Aozhou Zhong, a student in the IT program at James Cook University. 
This repository contains my practical work for CP1404 Programming II, 
demonstrating object-oriented programming concepts and software development practices.

## Clean Code Lessons Learned

Through CP1404, I have learned several important lessons about writing clean code:

- **Meaningful Naming**: Using descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes makes code more readable and maintainable. For example, `calculate_total_price()` is much clearer than `calc()`.

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each function or class should have one clear purpose. This makes code easier to test, debug, and modify without causing unintended side effects.

- **Consistent Formatting**: Following PEP 8 guidelines and using tools like PyCharm's "Reformat Code" feature ensures code is consistently formatted, which improves readability and collaboration.

- **Effective Documentation**: Writing clear docstrings and comments that explain why rather than what, while letting the code itself show how things are done.

- **DRY Principle**: Avoiding code duplication by creating reusable functions and classes, which reduces errors and makes maintenance easier.
